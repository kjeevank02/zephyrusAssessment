Problem-Solving Approach
Understanding the Requirement for Task2:

The task is to implement the classic FizzBuzz problem, where numbers from 1 to 100 are displayed, but:
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz."
Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz."
Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz."
All other numbers are displayed as themselves.
Additionally, the Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz results should be color-coded to improve readability and user experience.

Designing the Solution:
HTML Structure:
A button to trigger the FizzBuzz logic.
An output area to display the results.

CSS Styling:
Styles to center the panel, create a responsive interface, and apply colors to different categories (Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, and regular numbers).
JavaScript Functionality:
A function fizzBuzz() to generate the FizzBuzz output for numbers 1 to 100.
Each number is checked against divisibility by 3, 5, and both, and the appropriate output is created using <span> elements with class names for styling.

Implementation Details:
FizzBuzz Logic:
The function loops from 1 to 100.
For each number:
If divisible by both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is added to the results array.
If divisible by 3, "Fizz" is added.
If divisible by 5, "Buzz" is added.
Otherwise, the number itself is added.

Rendering Output:
The results are displayed in the output area by joining the results with <br> tags to create line breaks between each result.
Each result is wrapped in a span tag with a specific class for color-coding.

Handling Edge Cases:
Divisibility:
The logic ensures that numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are prioritized to display "FizzBuzz" first.

Output Length:
The results for 100 numbers are properly formatted and displayed in the output area with a scrollable container if the content exceeds the available space.

Responsiveness:
The CSS ensures that the design is responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes.

Handling Edge Cases:

Divisibility Check:
The program ensures the correct order of checks:
First, checks for divisibility by both 3 and 5 (FizzBuzz).
Then checks for divisibility by 3 (Fizz).
Finally, checks for divisibility by 5 (Buzz).
This ensures "FizzBuzz" is displayed where applicable and not split between "Fizz" and "Buzz."

No Results:
Since the range is from 1 to 100, there's no case where no results are generated.
The program always outputs a list of 100 items.

Scrolling the Output:
If the results exceed the available height, the output div has a scrollable container, which ensures the display remains user-friendly without cluttering the page.

Performance:
The function efficiently handles the loop of 100 iterations, and the results are dynamically generated and displayed. This approach is scalable for larger ranges as well.
